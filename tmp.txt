    title: 'The Light After the Storm',
    text: 'Raj was known in his town as the man who never said no. Whether it was helping a neighbor\n' +
      'fix a roof, guiding a lost student, or simply listening to someone’s troubles, he was always\n' +
      'there. His kindness was quiet but constant—like the sunrise, always showing up, expecting\n' +
      'nothing in return.\n' +
      'Years passed, and life wore on. The weight of unspoken struggles, years of giving without\n' +
      'pause, and personal losses began to pull Raj into a silent darkness. He didn’t know how to\n' +
      'ask for help—he never had to before. Slowly, depression crept in. His smile faded. His world\n' +
      'grew smaller.\n' +
      'Some people noticed… and walked away. He wasn’t the &quot;strong&quot; man they remembered. He\n' +
      'was quiet now. Tired. Not everyone understood.\n' +
      'But a few stayed.\n' +
      'His sister would visit every evening, just to sit with him. A friend from years ago brought\n' +
      'him to a doctor who gently explained what he was feeling had a name—and more\n' +
      'importantly, a path forward. With therapy, medication, and steady support, Raj began to feel\n' +
      'glimpses of himself returning.\n' +
      'He started with small steps—watering plants, walking to the market, writing in a notebook.\n' +
      'Days felt a little lighter. Hope crept in where the pain had lived.\n' +
      'Years later, Raj stood in front of a group of young people, sharing his story. “There was a\n' +
      'time I thought it would never get better,” he said softly. “But it did. Not overnight. Not easily.\n' +
      'But it did. The dark didn’t last forever.”',
    moral: 'No matter how heavy life feels, never lose hope. Healing is possible. Brighter days are\n' +
      'ahead.'

    title: 'The Well of Change',
    text: 'Naina was sharp, ambitious, and proud of it. In her corporate office, she was known for her\n' +
      'brilliance—but also for her coldness. She never offered a helping hand, never stayed behind\n' +
      'to support a colleague, and had no patience for those who struggled. Compassion, to her, was\n' +
      'a sign of weakness.\n' +
      'One long weekend, she joined a trekking expedition in the mountains, hoping for a break\n' +
      'from the monotony. The forest was dense, wild, and alive in ways she wasn’t used to. But\n' +
      'something unexpected happened—she got separated from her group during a steep descent.\n' +
      'Hours passed. No sign of anyone. No signal on her phone.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As panic set in, she wandered deeper into the forest until she slipped and fell into an old well\n' +
      'hidden by overgrowth. It was nearly 10 feet deep, damp, and chilling. She screamed for help,\n' +
      'but her voice only echoed back.\n' +
      'Her dog, Leo, who had followed her silently through the trek, appeared at the edge of the\n' +
      'well. His eyes were wide with confusion and worry. He barked. She cried. They were alone.\n' +
      'But then, something amazing happened.\n' +
      'Leo began to bring things—stones, sturdy sticks, even fruits—carrying them one by one in\n' +
      'his mouth and dropping them into the well. At first, Naina didn’t understand. Then, hope\n' +
      'flickered. She began building—a ladder of sorts—stacking stones and wedging sticks into\n' +
      'the wall. She used the roots along the damp walls for support. At night, she struck stones\n' +
      'together to make fire, protecting herself from insects and wild animals. She survived on the\n' +
      'fruits Leo brought, sharing every bite in silent gratitude.\n' +
      'Many times, the ladder would collapse, or her hands would bleed from the climbing. But she\n' +
      'didn&#39;t give up. Every failure taught her a better way. Every setback made her stronger.\n' +
      'Eight months passed.\n' +
      'Eight months of struggle. Of learning patience, humility, and resilience. And then, one\n' +
      'morning, with trembling limbs and a heart burning with determination, she climbed out.\n' +
      'She fell to the ground, kissed Leo’s muddy fur, and looked up at the sky with tears in her\n' +
      'eyes. The forest, once terrifying, now felt like home. A place where she had been\n' +
      'broken—and rebuilt.\n' +
      'When she returned to the city, people were shocked. Not just by her reappearance, but by her\n' +
      'change. She was no longer the arrogant, self-serving woman they knew. Naina now\n' +
      'volunteered at shelters, helped those in need, and offered kindness without being asked.\n' +
      'She had fallen into a well—but risen with purpose.',
    moral: 'Adversity can break us—or shape us. Never lose hope, and never underestimate the\n' +
      'power of kindness, even from a loyal dog. Every life has meaning—especially when lived\n' +
      'for others.'

    title: "The Weight We Don't Show",
    text: 'Arjun was the kind of man who always appeared to have it all together. A steady job, a clean\n' +
      'shirt, and a smile that never faltered. But behind that smile was a storm—a silent, heavy\n' +
      'pressure building day by day.\n' +
      'He hated his job. The endless emails, the constant deadlines, the mechanical routine—it all\n' +
      'drained him. Every morning he questioned whether he should quit, but fear of an uncertain\n' +
      'future always stopped him. “At least this puts food on the table,” he’d tell himself. He never\n' +
      'talked about how he felt. To his family, he was the pillar—strong, unshaken. And he believed\n' +
      'that showing any sign of weakness would be failing them.\n' +
      'But slowly, the stress started showing up in other ways. Frequent headaches, unexplained\n' +
      'palpitations, sleepless nights. Still, Arjun said nothing.\n' +
      'One evening, noticing his dull eyes and tired demeanor, his younger sister gently suggested a\n' +
      'break. “Just go somewhere peaceful for a few days. Breathe a little.”\n' +
      'Half-heartedly, Arjun packed his bag and left for the mountains.\n' +
      'The crisp mountain air was unfamiliar but refreshing. He wandered near a small stream one\n' +
      'morning, and something caught his eye—smooth stones at the bottom of a fountain. One in\n' +
      'particular had a deep, concave hollow carved into it. It looked as if water had been falling on\n' +
      'it for years.\n' +
      'He stared at it for a long time.\n' +
      '“Interesting, isn’t it?” came a calm voice behind him.\n' +
      'Startled, Arjun turned to see a monk, old but radiant with peace.\n' +
      'The monk smiled gently and said, “That stone wasn’t always like that. But drop by drop, the\n' +
      'falling water shaped it. Quietly. Relentlessly.”\n' +
      'Arjun nodded, still lost in thought.\n' +
      '“You see, the mind is the same. The stress you don&#39;t speak of—it doesn&#39;t disappear. It presses\n' +
      'down. Bit by bit, it shapes you too,” the monk said, now gazing at the flowing water. “Don’t\n' +
      'carry everything alone. It’s not weakness to feel. It&#39;s wisdom to share.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Then the monk added, “Live this moment fully. And when you go back, don’t just return to\n' +
      'your routine. Make a decision for your life.”\n' +
      'Before Arjun could reply, the monk was gone—disappearing into the trail, as suddenly as he\n' +
      'had appeared.\n' +
      'Arjun sat by the stream a while longer, feeling a strange sense of lightness. He wasn’t sure\n' +
      'what decision he would make yet—but for the first time, he felt permission to feel… and to\n' +
      'speak.\n' +
      'When he returned home, he spoke to his family. Not just about his job, but about his fears, his\n' +
      'exhaustion, and his longing for something more. They listened. They understood.',
    moral: 'Life is unpredictable, and while we may not be able to control others or the world\n' +
      'around us, accepting and expressing our stress can ease the burden and bring clarity. Even\n' +
      'the strongest need a space to breathe.'
