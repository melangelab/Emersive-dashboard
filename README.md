# LAMP Dashboard

LAMP Dashboard is a web application for managing and visualizing data, built with React and Node.js. It is designed for use in digital psychiatry research and clinical settings.

## Features
- Modern React frontend (TypeScript)
- Material UI and MUI components
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Data visualization (Recharts, Vega)
- OAuth and JWT authentication
- Docker support

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Git

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```

2. **Start the development server:**
	```bash
	npm run start
	```
	The app will run on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.

3. **Build for production:**
	```bash
	npm run build
	```
	The production build will be in the `build/` directory.

4. **Serve the build (optional):**
	```bash
	npm run start-sw
	```
	This serves the static build on port 3000.

## Environment Variables
- `.env` is auto-generated by `buildEnv.js` before build/start.
- You can customize ports and API endpoints in `buildEnv.js` or via npm scripts.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t lamp-dashboard .
docker run -p 8080:8080 lamp-dashboard
```

## Project Structure
